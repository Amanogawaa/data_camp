- **What is Data Science?**
    - Data science involves methodologies for collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data to extract meaningful insights.
    - Every digital interaction (likes, clicks, purchases) contributes to data that can describe the present or predict the future.
- **What Can Data Do?**
    - Data can **describe** (e.g., energy consumption dashboards), **detect anomalies** (e.g., fraud detection), **diagnose causes** (e.g., user behavior on Spotify/Netflix), and **predict** future events (e.g., population growth).
    - Predictions can also include probability assessments to quantify uncertainty.
- **Why is Data Science Popular Now?**    
    - The increasing volume of collected data makes analysis more valuable.
    - Businesses combine data from various sources (e.g., car dealership purchases + social media activity) to create detailed consumer profiles, optimizing marketing and decision-making.
- **The Data Science Workflow:**
    - **Data Collection** – Gathering data from multiple sources (surveys, wweb traffic, transactions).
    - **Data Preparation** – Cleaning and organizing data for usability.
    - **Exploration & Visualization** – Building dashboards, tracking trends, and comparing datasets.
    - **Experimentation & Prediction** – Running analyses to forecast trends (e.g., temperature changes, website performance).

## Application of Data Science
- **Introduction to Applications**
    - Data science can be applied to real-world problems, such as fraud detection, IoT, and deep learning.
- **Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)**
    - Banks use machine learning to predict fraudulent transactions by analyzing purchase details (amount, date, location).
    - Historical data (training data) helps build an algorithm that assesses the probability of fraud.
- **Requirements for Machine Learning**
    - A **well-defined question** (e.g., "Is this transaction fraudulent?").
    - **Historical data** with labeled examples (fraudulent or valid transactions).
    - **New data inputs** to make predictions on unseen transactions.
- **Smart Watches & IoT**
    - Smart watches use accelerometer data to detect activities like walking or running.
    - IoT devices (e.g., smart home systems, toll collection, energy management) generate valuable data for analysis.
- **Image Recognition & Deep Learning**
    - Self-driving cars use deep learning to detect humans in images.
    - Instead of traditional machine learning (which struggles with large image data), deep learning uses layers of neurons to extract patterns from massive datasets.
    - Deep learning excels in tasks like image classification and language understanding.

## Data Science Roles & Tools
- **Data Science Roles Overview**
    - Data science is not a single job; it consists of four main roles: **Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Scientist**.
- **Data Engineer**
    - Focuses on **data collection and storage** by building pipelines and infrastructure.
    - **Tools:** SQL, Java/Scala/Python, Shell scripting, Cloud computing.
- **Data Analyst**
    - **Explores and visualizes data** to describe trends.
    - **Focus:** Data **preparation, exploration, and visualization**.
    - **Tools:** SQL, Spreadsheets, BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker), Python/R (advanced users).
- **Data Scientist**
    - **Extracts insights and builds models** for prediction and forecasting.
    - **Focus:** Data **preparation, exploration, experimentation, and prediction**.
    - **Tools:** SQL, Python/R, data science libraries (pandas, tidyverse).
- **Machine Learning Scientist**
    - Specializes in **machine learning and deep learning**.
    - **Focus:** Prediction, using training data to classify complex datasets.
    - **Tools:** Python/R, machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, deep learning frameworks).
